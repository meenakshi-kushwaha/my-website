 About

Hello! Thanks for stopping by. 
<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am an environmental health researcher, consultant and educator. I have worked on a range of environmental health issues including lead poisoning, air pollution, and water quality in high and low/middle income countries. My work on pullution inequities in India was recently featured in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/17/world/asia/india-pollution-inequality.html)

I enjoy using and teaching R for data analysis, visualization, and reporting. I am inspired by the open source and collaborative nature of the R-community and hope to give back through teaching and training programs. 
  
I graduated with an MPH in Environmental and Occupational Health from the University of Washington, Seattle. My early carreer was in biomedical research, learnings from which continue to inform my current work.
