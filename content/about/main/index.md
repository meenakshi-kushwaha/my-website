  My current research is on developing air quality models using stationary and mobile measurements in India. I work with an amazing team at [ILK Labs](www.ilklabs.com) and a growing list of collaborators including Google, [CSTEP](https://cstep.in/), University of Washington, Seattle, and University of California, Berkely.
